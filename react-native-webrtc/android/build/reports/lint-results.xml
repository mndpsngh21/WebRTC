        id="GradleDynamicVersion"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Avoid using + in version numbers; can lead to unpredictable and unrepeatable builds (com.facebook.react:react-native:+)"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="4"
        summary="Gradle Dynamic Version"
        explanation="Using `+` in dependencies lets you automatically pick up the latest available version rather than a specific, named version. However, this is not recommended; your builds are not repeatable; you may have tested with a slightly different version than what the build server used. (Using a dynamic version as the major version number is more problematic than using it in the minor version position.)"

        category="Performance"
        priority="6"
        summary="Obsolete SDK_INT Version Check"
        explanation="This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the `minSdkVersion` (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high as the version checked for.&#xA;&#xA;Similarly, it also looks for resources in `-vNN` folders, such as `values-v14` where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the `minSdkVersion`, where the contents should be merged into the best folder."
